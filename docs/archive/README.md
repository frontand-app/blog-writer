# Archive

This directory contains original files from the initial implementation that have been refactored into the main codebase.

## Files

- **Content Gen v4.1.json**: Original n8n workflow definition that served as the blueprint for the Python implementation
- **gemini_validator_agent.py**: Original URL validation script (refactored into `src/agents/validator.py`)
- **run_deep_research.py**: Original deep research script (refactored into `src/agents/research.py`)

These files are kept for reference purposes only and are not used in the current implementation.
